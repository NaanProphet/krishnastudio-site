## What It Is

Automation in audio editing is like keyframes in video editing. It allows for parametrization of any effect you can think of â€” volume, panning, etc.

## Open Automation

1. Press `a`

2. Expand the track if you don't see the automation curve/data

## Modes

1. By hand - using the **Pencil Tool** to draw in your automation (works in any mode)
2. By feel - **Touch mode** (falls back to existing curve once released)
3. By feel - **Latch mode** (overwrites everything to the right once released)
