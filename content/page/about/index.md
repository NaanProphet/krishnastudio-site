Thanks for stopping by!

I love creating, learning, and trying new things. I studied physics and music in university. 📚🎼

I'm a software developer by day, and that lets me care deeply about the projects I take up. I learned how to film and edit my friends' recitals during school which was a lot of fun. I listened to a lot of great music that way too.

My freshman year of undergrad I bought my first MacBook. Never looked back. 🧑‍💻

My ideal day involves being outside, fixing things, and helping others.

Hope you find something helpful here!
