#### Shortlist

Again this is for mixing onlyâ€”not recording.

1. Increase **Buffer Size**
2. Increase **Process Buffer Range**
3. **Remove Inputs** to Audio Tracks (not from buses/submixes)
4. Ensure a **non Software-Instrument Track** is selected
5. **Freeze** Tracks (aka defeat). Move project to an SSD for max disk performance
