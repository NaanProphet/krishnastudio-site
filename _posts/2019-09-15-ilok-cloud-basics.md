#### TL;DR

When you log into iLok Cloud on one machine, it automatically logs you out of the other machine.

1. Open iLok License Manager and Sign In
2. `Open Cloud Session` (⌘⇧C)

#### About iLok Cloud

iLok Cloud is only supported by some plugins. For example Slate's plugins do, but Anteres Auto Tune does not (yet).

With a Cloud session the iLok USB dongle is not necessary, but the machine needs to be continously connected to the internet, because it keeps polling every few minutes.

You can opt to use the USB dongle instead by selecting `Close Cloud Session` and then activating it to a physical iLok device instead.
