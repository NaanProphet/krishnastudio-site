#### Epiphany

Most revelations seem trivial or obvious after the fact. This is one of them.

For a long time, mixing and mastering seemed like the same thing, or rather, too similar to be truly different things. It first hit me when I realized what automation ([see previous post here]({% post_url 2019-09-16-basic-automation %})) actually automatesâ€”the movement of someone's hands on a mixer!

#### Mixing

In the older days, mixing was done in realtime. Talk about pressure! Literally someone moved their fingers adjusting settings on a soundboard while playing back all the tracks. Similar to live sound in a way. This process reduces N tracks into 2 track stereo (typically).[^1]

Sure, there may be channel EQ and compression settings during the mixing phase (like in live sound), but for the most part, the focus during mixing is on the relative volume of the tracks to each other.

#### Mastering

Mastering, then, applies final EQ and compression to the stereo mix so that it provides an overall style/color and conforms to broadcast standards.[^2] There are so many different directions one can go in which is why mastering is its own phase.
