*Updated Oct 14, 2019 with HD 650s.*

#### K701 vs Q701

* K701 feels muddier than the Q701. Less clarity in low bass
* Q701 made the mix sound less boomy than I think it actually is
* Q701 pulls the vocals out, brighter than K701
* Q701 appears to have slightly higher impedance (sounds softer for same volume setting)

Kind of feel like I can't trust either yet. Need to try another model.

#### DT 990 PRO (250 Ohms)

* Bass not muddy! Definitely more powerful though, similar to what I remember in the car
* Easier to identify areas that need to be balanced
* This wins over both K701 and Q701
* I kind of feel like these fatigue my ears slightly faster than the AKGs. The Q701s were easiest to listen to

#### HD 600s

* Easier than the DT 990 PRO to identify where levels and EQ are not balanced!!
    * Endrum Mix_v2 - Transition at 2:46
    * In contrast, the DT 990 PRO smooths this out!
* Want to keep this one ðŸ’™

#### HD 650s

* Not a HUGE jump between this and the 600s
* Feels nicer on my head than the 600s though
* Doesn't tire my ears as fast as the 600s â€” important for long mixing sessions

My friend described his HD 650 unboxing as:

> When I first put them on, I was actually somewhat unimpressed. I thought to myself, "Wow is this it?" But then I compared it to my HD 280s (noticed a little difference), put the 650s back on, and the difference was immediately apparent. It was a huge relief actually. Everything just sounds so natural and how itâ€™s supposed to sound. I think thatâ€™s why I was initially unimpressed. Everything just sounds like itâ€™s supposed to sound. No extra coloration or anything.

It's worth noting that [Sonarworks has an HD 650 review](https://www.sonarworks.com/blog/reviews/sennheiser-hd650-review/) and uses the 650s themselves but an HD 600 review isn't present.

HD 650 definitely feels like the gold standard. ðŸ’™++
