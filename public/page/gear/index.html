<li>12x optical zoom, 18x &ldquo;Clear Image Zoom&rdquo; at 4K (but cannot do face detection then)</li>
<li>Unable to pipe 4K via HDMI <em>while</em> recording to SD card, so have to switch to HD when doing live stream + recording. Bandwidth issues I assume.</li>
<li>In 4K mode the camera doesn&rsquo;t zoom in as far as in 1080 HD mode—it&rsquo;s using the same sensor.</li>
<li>No built-in histogram viewer (feed HDMI to your own scopes, see below)</li>

<li>These RCA attenuators are vital for recording off prosumer -10dB REC/TAPE OUT feeds from a mixer into a portable audio recorder like the Zoom H1. Otherwise, transients in the 0-12dB range on the mixer will not have enough headroom to record</li>
